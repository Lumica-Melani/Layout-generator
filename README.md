# Flexbox Layout Generator

A visual, interactive **CSS Flexbox layout generator** built with React. This tool lets you experiment with Flexbox properties in real time and instantly see how layout changes affect your UI — no guesswork, no constant tab‑switching to docs.

Perfect for learners, frontend developers, and designers who want to **understand Flexbox by doing**.

---

## Features

- **Dynamic item count** (with safety limits)
- ↔ **Flex direction & wrapping controls**
- **Gap, width, height & border radius adjustments**
- **Alignment controls** (`justify-content`, `align-content`)
- **Style toggle** to visualize layout boundaries
- **Preset layouts** for quick experimentation
- Clean, beginner‑friendly UI

---

## Why this project?

Flexbox is powerful — but abstract. Reading documentation only goes so far.

This generator helps you:

- Visually understand how Flexbox properties interact
- Understand how **DOM MANIPULATION** works
- Debug layout issues faster
- Build intuition instead of memorizing values
- Experiment safely without breaking real projects

It’s essentially a **Flexbox playground**, made with learning-first UX in mind.

---

## Tech Stack

- **React** (component-based architecture)
- **Tailwind CSS** (custom themed UI)
- **Modern JavaScript (ES6+)**

No external layout libraries. Everything is handled through native Flexbox.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lumica-Melani/Layout-generator.git
cd Layout-generator
```

### 2. Install dependencies

npm install
```

### 3. Run the app locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in your terminal).

## How to Use

1. Set the **number of flex items**
2. Choose a **flex direction** and **wrap behavior**
3. Adjust spacing, size, and border radius
4. Experiment with **alignment controls**
5. Toggle styles to visualize item boundaries
6. Try presets for common layout patterns

All changes update the layout **instantly**.

---

## Presets Included

- **Centered** – Perfect centering demo
- **Space Between** – Navigation-style layout
- **Card Layout** – Responsive card grid behavior

Presets help beginners like me understand common real‑world use cases quickly.

## Learning Focus

This project was built with an emphasis on:

- DOM manipulation through state
- Controlled components in React
- Mapping UI controls directly to CSS behavior
- Building reusable, readable components

---

## Future Improvements

- Copy generated CSS to clipboard
- Individual item controls (`align-self`)
- Grid layout generator (CSS Grid)
- Responsive preview modes
- Save & share layouts

Happy Learning! 💪
